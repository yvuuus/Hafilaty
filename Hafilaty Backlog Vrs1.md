# Backlog Overview:

1. ## **Front End and UI/UX** *(Meriem, Romaissa)*:

   * ### **Task 1**: Design the Login and Sign-up Interface.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Create wireframes and mockups for the login and sign-up screens.  
       * Implement the user authentication page (sign-in/sign-up).

     * #### **Report**: Write a report detailing the design process and feedback from initial user testing.

   * ### **Task 2**: Design the Passenger Interface.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Map display layout (showing user's location and bus tracking).  
       * Implement search bar for destination entry.  
       * Add buttons for the nearest station and saved places.

     * #### **Report**: Include wireframes, mockups, and user testing feedback.

   * ### **Task 3**: Design the Driver Interface.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Design the map showing the driverâ€™s route and stops.  
       * Implement schedule display interface.  
       * Placeholder for inbox (optional).

     * #### **Report**: Present wireframes and details about interaction design.

   * ### **Task 4**: Design the Bus Agency Interface.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Create an interface to display all buses on a map.  
       * Add buttons for driver management and schedule modification.

     * #### **Report**: Document design choices and potential user interactions.

2. ## **Back End** *(Imtinane)*:

   * ### **Task 1**: Implement User Authentication Logic.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Set up authentication for passengers, drivers, and the bus agency.  
       * Handle sign-up (passenger, agency), login (all users), and account creation by the agency (for drivers).

     * #### **Report**: Document the process of integrating the authentication system and any issues faced.

   * ### **Task 2**: Implement Real-Time Bus Location Tracking.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Set up the database for storing bus GPS data.  
       * Ensure real-time updates are reflected on the passenger and agency interfaces.

     * #### **Report**: Document how real-time tracking was implemented and how data is being updated.

   * ### **Task 3**: Implement Schedule Management for Agency and Driver.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Build the backend logic to assign schedules to drivers.  
       * Ensure that drivers can view their assigned schedules in real-time.

     * #### **Report**: Document the back end workflow for schedule creation and updates.

3. ## **APIs** *(Yousra)*:

   * ### **Task 1**: Integrate API.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Retrieve and display maps for passengers and drivers.  
       * Ensure real-time tracking of buses is possible using the map.

     * #### **Report**: Document the API integration and any challenges encountered.

   * ### **Task 2**: Implement GPS and Location Services.

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Use GPS APIs to retrieve and send bus locations.  
       * Ensure the data is available in real-time to both passengers and the agency.

     * #### **Report**: Include details about GPS accuracy and reliability issues, if any.

   * ### **Task 3**: Implement Communication Between Driver and Agency (Optional).

     * #### **Subtasks**:

       * Set up an API or service for sending and receiving messages between drivers and the agency.  
       * Create a placeholder for possible expansion.

     * #### **Report**: Document the setup and any potential future expansion ideas.

# Reports:

After each task, the responsible team member should:

1. **Summarize** what was done.  
2. **Highlight** any challenges or issues faced.  
3. **Provide** documentation of the implementation process (e.g., screenshots, code snippets, diagrams).  
4. **Note** any areas where improvements or adjustments may be needed.
