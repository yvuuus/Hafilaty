### 1.5 Overview
This document outlines the functionality, features, user roles, and non-functional requirements of the **Bus Tracking System**. The system provides real-time bus tracking, ETAs. It also includes an administrator dashboard for managing bus fleets and drivers. The key users include commuters, bus drivers, and administrators, each with tailored interfaces. The non-functional requirements focus on system performance, scalability, usability, and security to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Bus Tracking System is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing public transportation ecosystem. It will enhance the overall efficiency of bus operations by providing real-time location data, and scheduling information. The system will interact with a variety of existing hardware and software systems, including GPS tracking devices installed on buses, mobile and web applications for commuters, and administrative systems used by transportation authorities.

### 2.2 Product Features

#### **User Interface**

- Enabling users to Track the live location of buses using GPS and updating the location in real-time and displaying their current position on a map and the estimated arrival time from pickup location to destination 
- Enables users to create and manage personal accounts.  
- Allows saving of the most frequented places.  
- Provides real-time ETA for buses at designated stops.  
- Continuously updates the ETA based on live traffic conditions.

#### **Driver Interface**

- Provides bus drivers with real-time route information, including live traffic updates, and schedule adjustments.  
- Displays the current route, next stops, and updated ETAs for the driver.

#### **Administrator Dashboard**

- Administrators can view all buses in the fleet on a map, showing their real-time locations, routes  
- Administrators can upload, edit, and manage bus schedules directly from the dashboard.  
- Ability to add new drivers and assign them to specific buses.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

#### **Commuters (General Users)**

- **Description**: These are the end-users who use the system to track buses, view bus schedules.  
- **Technical Expertise**: Basic to moderate tech skills, familiar with using mobile apps.  
- **Access Rights**:
  - Can view real-time bus locations and ETAs.  
  - Can search bus routes and schedules.  
  - No administrative control over the system.  

#### **Bus Drivers**

- **Description**: Bus drivers interact with the system through a dedicated interface, receiving real-time updates on routes, traffic, and schedule changes.  
- **Technical Expertise**: Basic familiarity with driver apps or onboard devices.  
- **Access Rights**:
  - Can view assigned routes and stops.  
  - Receive notifications on route changes or delays.  
  - Can communicate with administrators through the system.  
  - No access to commuter data or administrative functions.

#### **Administrators (Fleet Managers)**

- The accuracy of the bus location is dependent on the availability of reliable GPS data.  
- The application will depend on third-party map services and APIs (such as Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap API) for the map view, real-time data visualization, and bus location tracking.  
- The system will utilize an external **GPS tracking API** to retrieve real-time bus location data.  
- The application may require integration with a public transportation API (if available) for route and bus schedule data to complement real-time tracking.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Feature: Bus Tracking

**Description**: Allows passengers to track the live location of buses in real-time on a map.

**Functional Requirements**:
- **Real-Time Location Updates**:  
  The app fetches the busâ€™s current GPS coordinates every 5 seconds. The map updates automatically to display the new bus location.
  
- **Tracking on the Map**:  
  When a user taps on a bus icon, a popup will display additional information about the bus, such as the route, next stop, and ETA.
  
- **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**:  
  The ETA is calculated dynamically based on real-time traffic and bus location data. The app will refresh the ETA every 30 seconds or whenever a significant change in the busâ€™s position is detected.

- **Notifications**:  
  Push notifications will be sent when a bus is within 5 minutes of the selected stop. If there are any delays exceeding 10 minutes, the app will send a delay notification.

- **User Interaction with the Map**:  
  Users can zoom in/out and move the map to see other buses. Multiple bus routes can be displayed at once, with each bus color-coded based on its status (on-time, delayed).
